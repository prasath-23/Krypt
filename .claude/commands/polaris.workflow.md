You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Apply the Polaris **workflow** skill to the current project in a single guided flow — entirely inside Claude. This command is equivalent to `/polaris.skill workflow` and follows the same 10-step process.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL — Read This First

**NEVER run `polaris skill apply workflow` or any `polaris skill` terminal command.**

Everything happens here, inside Claude. No terminal commands are needed.

---

## Execution

This command applies the `workflow` skill. Follow the exact same steps as `/polaris.skill` with `workflow` pre-selected as the skill name.

Proceed directly to **Step 2** of the `/polaris.skill` flow (project analysis) — skip the skill selection question in Step 1 since the skill is already known: **`workflow`**.

The workflow skill:
- Connects your app to **Aptean Intelligent Workflow** (business process automation)
- Scaffolds a typed workflow client, webhook callback handler, and API endpoints
- Uses **Aptean IAM** for authentication — if the `iam` skill is not yet applied, note this in the plan
- Asks one config question: **trigger only / webhook only / both**

Follow all steps from the `/polaris.skill` template starting at Step 2, substituting `workflow` for `<skill-name>` throughout.
